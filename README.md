![Quisiin Logo](https://storage.googleapis.com/bangkit-capstone-c23-pc667-user-bucket/other/QUISIIN_C23-PC667.gslides.png)

Welcome to the Quisiin Machine Learning Flask API, an integral part of the Quisiin app â€“ a marketplace for creating and sharing questionnaires. This project is part of the Bangkit 2023 Product-Based Capstone Project.

## About Quisiin

Quisiin is a questionnaire marketplace that can help users find specific respondents to fill out their research. Users can also fill out other people's questionnaires and earn points as rewards if they have filled out the questionnaire.

## Machine Learning Flask API

The Machine Learning Flask API serves as the backend for the Quisiin app, providing machine learning capabilities for questionnaire analysis and recommendation. It exposes a set of endpoints that allow users to interact with the machine learning models and receive intelligent insights based on the collected data.

## Key Features

- Questionnaire analysis using machine learning algorithms
- Intelligent recommendation engine for personalized questionnaire suggestions
- Seamless integration with the Quisiin app for a seamless user experience
- Secure API endpoints with authentication and authorization
- Scalable architecture for handling large-scale data processing
